## Merge-Request Guidelines

* Avoid overly-complex code. Follow the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) guidelines.
* Ensure your code meets the project's current code-style.
* Test your changes personally before requesting them to be committed.
* Don't commit changes that simply refactor existing code or its code style.
* Use NodeJS modules supported by BetterDiscord in preference to writing your own methods.
* Comment each component of your changes using block quotes and be as detailed as possible. ( `/* ... */` )
* General internal methods should begin with two underscores ( `__` ) and be declared as static. ( If applicable. )
