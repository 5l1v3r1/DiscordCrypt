**DiscordCrypt™** is a plugin for Discord that uses 
    [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases)'s internal structure to 
    send and receive encrypted messages between users and channels in a safe and secure manner.

The plugin achieves this by using 
    [multiple levels of encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_encryption) 
    with well known ciphers to ensure only the people you want to read your messages can read them 
    and ***no one else***.
